void main() {
This is the main function. Every Dart program starts running from here.

int sh1 = 19;
A variable named sh1 is created to store the number 19.
 int means it's a whole number (integer).

int sh2 = 11;
Another variable sh2 is created and stores the number 11.

int sh3 = sh1 + sh2;

The program adds the value of sh1 (19) and sh2 (11).
 19 + 11 = 30, and this total is saved in a new variable called sh3.

print(sh3);   The print() function shows the value of sh3 on the screen.
So, it displays 30.

}  This ends the main function.
